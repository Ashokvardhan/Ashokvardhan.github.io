<h1>Meditation resources</h1>
</div>
<p>To anyone out there who has ever experienced any sort of mental health issues or even if not, please remember that you are not alone and there are always people to support and help you. In fact, we all face such issues everyday and it's perfectly normal. It's a sign of strength, not a weakness, to realize that you need help. I myself had been in these shoes for a long while. The most important thing in life is to take care of your mental well being. Everything else is secondary. Stay strong and take care of yourselves. Please keep in mind that things always change in life and whatever you are going through is just temporary and things will be normal and you can be your confident self once again :)
Even though you may not know me, if you feel like talking about these or in general, please do not hesitate to drop me a message. You are always welcome :)</p>
<p>Following are some of the meditation resources that have been of tremendous help to me and changed me forever. I hope some of you find them helpful too .</p>
